This is my scriptable object based Inventory System. Included in this repo is a Unity Project with all of my files pertaining to the inventory, including the managers, slots, and scriptable objects. It also has some example set up for adding, removing, and selling these scriptable objects.
Included in the wiki is full documentation for every script in the project.
